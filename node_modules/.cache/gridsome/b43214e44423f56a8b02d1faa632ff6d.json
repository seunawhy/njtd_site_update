If the similarity index is higher than 25%, such article is rejected at that stage and the corresponding author is communicated. Articles that pass this stage will be allocated to a Section Editor, who assigns a minimum of three reviewers to evaluate the scientific quality of the manuscript. However, the Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles, and this decision is final. \\n        </p><p class=\\\"mb-3\\\" data-v-6135f735>\\n          Authors are encouraged to download the article processing flowchart from our homepage.

As a result, publishing of an article in the Journal requires an Article Publication Charge (APC), which will be billed following the acceptance of the article. Aside from this, the Journal does not impose any other charge on the author, be it submission charge or colour charge. \\n        </p><p class=\\\"mb-3\\\" data-v-6135f735>\\n          The APC will be charged based on the corresponding author’s affiliation. Where the corresponding author has a dual affiliation, the affiliation of where the work was carried out will be used. For the corresponding authors based in Nigeria, the APC of ₦60,000.00 (NGN) will be imposed while $150.00 (USD) will be imposed on corresponding authors outside Nigeria. The publication fee is non-refundable once the article is published online. Payment can be made by International Bank wire transfer, Western Union money transfer, MoneyGram, Online money transfer, or Payoneer. \\n        </p><p data-v-6135f735>\\n          Payment instructions will be sent to the corresponding author by the Managing Editor after the acceptance of the paper. The evidence of payment should be uploaded on the portal against the submission immediately after payment.\\n        </p></div><div class=\\\"mb-10 text-justify\\\" data-v-6135f735><h6 class=\\\"font-semibold mb-1 text-xl blue-text\\\" data-v-6135f735>\\n          Subscription and Advertisement\\n        </h6><p class=\\\"mb-3\\\" data-v-6135f735>\\n          The subscription and advertisement rates can be obtained from the Editor-in-Chief, the Managing Editor or the Business Manager.

All submissions will be initially assessed by the Editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed technically suitable are then subjected to plagiarism check. If the similarity index is higher than 25%, such article is rejected at that stage and the corresponding author is communicated. Articles that pass this stage will be allocated to a Section Editor, who assigns a minimum of three reviewers to evaluate the scientific quality of the manuscript. However, the Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles, and this decision is final. \\n        </p><p class=\\\"mb-3\\\" data-v-6135f735>\\n          Authors are encouraged to download the article processing flowchart from our homepage. The document summarises the peer review process used by NJTD. Authors should note that this process may last up to three months on the average.  \\n        </p></div></section>\")])\n}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }"],"mappings":"AAAA,IAAIA,MAAM,GAAG,SAASA,MAAT,GAAiB;EAAC,IAAIC,GAAG,GAAC,IAAR;EAAA,IAAaC,EAAE,GAACD,GAAG,CAACE,KAAJ,CAAUD,EAA1B;;EAA6B,OAAOA,EAAE,CAAC,KAAD,EAAO;IAACE,WAAW,EAAC,OAAb;IAAqBC,KAAK,EAAC;MAAC,MAAK;IAAN;EAA3B,CAAP,EAA8D,CAACJ,GAAG,CAACK,QAAJ,CAAa,i4CAAg4CL,GAAG,CAACM,QAAJ,CAAcN,GAAG,CAACO,kBAAlB,EAAsC,UAASC,OAAT,EAAiB;IAAC,OAAQ,0FAAwFR,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAeT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOF,OAAO,CAACA,OAAf,CAAf,CAAxF,GAAgI,kEAAhI,GAAmMR,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAeT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOF,OAAO,CAACG,YAAf,CAAf,CAAnM,GAAgP,uEAAhP,GAAwTX,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAeT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOF,OAAO,CAACI,IAAf,CAAf,CAAxT,GAA6V,0DAA7V,GAAwZZ,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAeT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOF,OAAO,CAACK,MAAf,CAAf,CAAxZ,GAA+b,0DAA/b,GAA0fb,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAeT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOF,OAAO,CAACM,MAAf,CAAf,CAA1f,GAAiiB,MAAjiB,IAA0iBN,OAAO,CAACO,IAAT,GAAgB,oEAAmEf,GAAG,CAACM,QAAJ,CAAcE,OAAO,CAACO,IAAtB,EAA4B,UAASC,IAAT,EAAc;MAAC,OAAQ,kGAAgGhB,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAe,2BAAyBT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOM,IAAI,CAACC,GAAZ,CAAzB,GAA0C,sBAAzD,CAAhG,GAAiL,oGAAjL,GAAuRjB,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOM,IAAI,CAACE,KAAZ,CAAvR,GAA2S,cAAnT;IAAmU,CAA9W,CAAnE,GAAob,QAApc,GAA8c,SAAv/B,IAAkgC,OAA1gC;EAAmhC,CAA3kC,CAAh4C,GAA88E,qlCAA98E,GAAqiHlB,GAAG,CAACM,QAAJ,CAAcN,GAAG,CAACmB,mBAAlB,EAAuC,UAASH,IAAT,EAAc;IAAC,OAAQ,kJAAgJhB,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAe,qBAAmBT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOM,IAAI,CAACI,KAAZ,CAAnB,GAAsC,kBAArD,CAAhJ,IAA2NJ,IAAI,CAACD,IAAN,GAAa,qDAAoDf,GAAG,CAACM,QAAJ,CAAcU,IAAI,CAACD,IAAnB,EAAyB,UAASM,OAAT,EAAiB;MAAC,OAAQ,kDAAgDrB,GAAG,CAACS,UAAJ,CAAe,yBAAuBT,GAAG,CAACU,EAAJ,CAAOW,OAAP,CAAvB,GAAuC,oBAAtD,CAAhD,GAA4H,OAApI;IAA6I,CAAxL,CAApD,GAA+O,OAA5P,GAAqQ,SAA/d,IAA0e,OAAlf;EAA2f,CAAjjB,CAAriH,GAAylI,g+OAAtmI,CAAD,CAA9D,CAAT;AAC3D,CADD;;AAEA,IAAIC,eAAe,GAAG,EAAtB;AAEA,SAASvB,MAAT,EAAiBuB,eAAjB"}]}
