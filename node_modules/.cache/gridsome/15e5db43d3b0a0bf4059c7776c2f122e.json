Articles that pass this stage will be allocated to a Section Editor, who assigns a minimum of three reviewers to evaluate the scientific quality of the manuscript. However, the Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles, and this decision is final. \n        </p>\n        <p class=\"mb-3\">\n          Authors are encouraged to download the article processing flowchart from our homepage.
