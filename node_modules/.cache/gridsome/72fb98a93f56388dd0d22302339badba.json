For the corresponding authors based in Nigeria, the APC of ₦60,000.00 (NGN) will be imposed while $150.00 (USD) will be imposed on corresponding authors outside Nigeria. The publication fee is non-refundable once the article is published online. Payment can be made by International Bank wire transfer, Western Union money transfer, MoneyGram, Online money transfer, or Payoneer. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Payment instructions will be sent to the corresponding author by the Managing Editor after the acceptance of the paper.

If the similarity index is higher than 25%, such article is rejected at that stage and the corresponding author is communicated. Articles that pass this stage will be allocated to a Section Editor, who assigns a minimum of three reviewers to evaluate the scientific quality of the manuscript. However, the Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles, and this decision is final. \r\n        </p>\r\n        <p class=\"mb-3\">\r\n          Authors are encouraged to download the article processing flowchart from our homepage.
