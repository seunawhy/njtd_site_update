                <p class="mb-3 text-justify">NJTD operates a double anonymised peer review process. All submissions will be initially assessed by the Editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed technically suitable are then subjected to plagiarism check. If the similarity index is higher than 25%, such article is rejected at that stage and the corresponding author is communicated. Articles that pass this stage will be allocated to a Section Editor, who assigns a minimum of three reviewers to evaluate the scientific quality of the manuscript. However, the Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles, and this decision is final.</p>
                <p class="mb-3 text-justify">Authors are encouraged to download the article processing flowchart from our homepage. The document summarises the peer review process used by NJTD. Authors should note that this process may last up to three months on the average. We therefore encourage authors to write to request for updates on the status of their submission(s) only when the said period has elapsed.</p>
